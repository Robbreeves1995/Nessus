# Nessus
Nessus is one of the worlds most popular vulnerability scanners. I will be utilizing Nessus to target machines and write up a report based upon findings within that targeted system. 

Key Objectives- 
1. Configuring Nessus to target host.
2. Running a scan to said host.
3. Interpreting the results of the scan.
4. Creating a remediation plan based upon results.
